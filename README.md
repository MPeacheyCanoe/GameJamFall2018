# GameJamFall2018

This is the Git Repo that we used to construct our game for the Fall-2018 edition of GameJam!  This game is constructed inside of an html file using the P5.js and P5.play javascript libraries.  It is a space-invaders style shooter with an **epic** boss battle after you reach a certian score.  Beware of the Whale!
